## 🧪 Post-Deployment Testing

### Functionality Tests:
- [ ] Application loads without errors
- [ ] Chat interface is accessible
- [ ] Medical queries return responses
- [ ] Session management works
- [ ] Error handling works properly

### Performance Tests:
- [ ] Response times are acceptable
- [ ] Memory usage is within limits
- [ ] API calls are working correctly

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- [ ] **Build Failures:** Check requirements.txt compatibility
- [ ] **Runtime Errors:** Verify API keys and Pinecone index
- [ ] **Memory Issues:** Consider upgrading from free tier
- [ ] **Port Issues:** App uses PORT env var automatically

### Environment Variables:
- [ ] `PINECONE_API_KEY` is set correctly
- [ ] `GROQ_API_KEY` is set correctly
- [ ] Pinecone index "medical-chatbot-1" exists and is accessible

## 📊 Monitoring

### After Deployment:
- [ ] Monitor Render logs for errors
- [ ] Check API usage and costs
- [ ] Test with various medical queries
- [ ] Verify session persistence
- [ ] Test error scenarios

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:
- [ ] Application is accessible via Render URL
- [ ] Chat functionality works end-to-end
- [ ] Medical queries return relevant responses
- [ ] No critical errors in logs
- [ ] API keys are properly configured

## 📝 Notes

- Free tier has limitations on requests and memory
- Monitor Groq and Pinecone usage to control costs
- Consider upgrading plans based on usage
- Keep API keys secure and never commit them to repository
